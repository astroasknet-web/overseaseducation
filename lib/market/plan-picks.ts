 * The courses a student may choose from their plan: the ones recommended after their resume scan. Pure, so it can be tested without a database.
 *
 *   1. The courses the scan recommended (section 1 of the stored result), in the order the scan gave them.
 *   2. If fewer than MIN_RECOMMENDED of those can be studied on Yugty (lessons exist, `isNative`), the list is topped up so a student always has at least
 *      three to choose from: the courses recommended for the domain the scan detected, then the general ones, then a short fixed list of career-ready courses.
 *
 * Only a course taught on Yugty can be studied, so only those are offered. The plan decides how many of them can be chosen (lib/market/plan-quota.ts).
