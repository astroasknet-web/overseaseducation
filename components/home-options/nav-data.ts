/**
 * The site navigation: one list of menus, grouped by what a visitor is trying to do (learn, build a career, study abroad, find help, or buy for a team).
 * Every link here is a page that exists in this application (a test checks that each internal link resolves to a route, and that field keys and country
 * slugs are real). Nothing is listed that is not built, and no figure (counts, prices) is written into a label, so a label can never go out of date.
